    <h3>About</h3>

      ROAM is an interactive urban exploration and mapping game for smart phones that helps players get lost. Players use the mobile web app to get lost in the city and then document their journey with photographs and text tags. ROAM asks players to let go of control, explore the city, and focus on observing and creatively capturing their journey. ROAM is a creative tool that subverts our reliance upon and relationship to precision navigation technologies and how they shape our experience of our world and our selves.

      The proposal for ROAM won the 2014 CADD FUNd: Winner Takes All. The CADD FUNd makes it possible for high-impact ideas that need the support of the Dallas-Fort Worth community, to be recognized and funded.

    <h3>Game Play</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4 class="text-justify">
      To ROAM, players must enter the amount of time they want to get lost and the game cycles DIRECTION PROMPTS with CAPTURE PROMPTS until the time has elapsed. DIRECTION PROMPTS give the player navigation instructions, while CAPTURE PROMPTS suggest a subject or inspiration for photographs. After each photograph, the player enters text tags to each image.
    </h4>
    <h4 class="text-justify">
      At the end of game play, each players photographic responses are collated into the GALLERY where players tags and journeys create a collective mapping of space. Over time, many players' journeys are compiled and geotagged onto an interactive map.
