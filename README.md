# ROAM
We all get lost sometimes, the individual who came up with this project got so lost that they tried to trap other into their meaningless vortex. The only escape from a vortex is obviously more vortex. like cow bell it is the end in and of itself lost and hopeless in carelessness unaware of the damage it creates. Driving those who give too many shits about nothing into a hole. But the hole was lacking any meaning to begin with so the night closes in and the dream of unity was only a lie we tell ourselves to go to sleep at night.
